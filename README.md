*A simple, lightweight, Material Design themed unit converter for iOS.*


The beautiful Material Design user interface allows for quick and easy conversions from a number in one unit to another. The goal is to keep it simple - you won't be overwhelmed with an excess of options and settings, allowing you to perform your desired conversion as quickly as possible. Perfect for work, school or in the kitchen.

- Temperature (celsius, fahrenheit, kelvin, etc)
- Length (kilometer, miles, meter, yard, feet, etc)
- Mass/Weight (kilogram, pound, ounce, ton, stone, etc)
- Speed (km/h, mph, knot, etc)
- Area (square kilometer, square mile, hectare, acre, etc)

- Pressure (kilopascal, bar, PSI, etc)
- Power (watt, kilowatt, horsepower, etc)
- Energy (joule, calorie, BTU, etc)

- Fuel Consumption (miles per gallon, liters per 100km, etc)
- Digital Storage (bit, byte, megabytes, gigabytes, etc)

Usage
------
- Use the slide-in menu for navigation between conversions and select the units you require. To open the slide-in menu, swipe in from the left edge of the app, or press the app icon in the top left corner.

- The converted value is fully customizable. Use the Settings menu to select the number of decimal places required as well as the grouping and decimal separators.

- Long-pressing on the converted value copies it to the clipboard.

- Pressing the swap Floating Action Button switches the selected units.

Building Yourself
-----------------
When building the project yourself, make sure to use the `base` build variant.  This will avoid using any of the Google services (such as Firebase or In-app billing) that contain my own private information.
